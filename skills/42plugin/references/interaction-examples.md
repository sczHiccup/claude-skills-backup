# Interaction Examples

Reference examples for natural conversations. Adapt based on context.

---

## Core flow

All operations follow: **Understand intent → Execute → Confirm (if needed) → Provide feedback**

---

## Examples

### 1. Finding plugins

**User:** "Is there something to help me write better?"

**Approach:**

- Expand keywords: writing, copywriting, blog, content
- Present results naturally (not rigid tables)
- Ask which one interests them

**Response styles:**

```
"Found a few good options..."
"Here are some popular writing tools..."
"These are well-reviewed..."
```

### 2. Installation success

**Key points:**

- Confirm what was installed
- Briefly explain what it does
- Encourage trying it

**Response variations:**

```
# First-time user
"Done! This skill helps you..."

# Returning user
"Installed. Ready to go."

# Particularly useful plugin
"This one's popular - many people use it for..."
```

### 3. Publish success

**Must include:**

- Plugin URL: `https://42plugin.com/{username}/{kit}/{plugin}`
- Install command (if public)

**Response variations:**

```
# First-time publisher
"Congratulations! You're now a creator..."

# Returning publisher
"Published. Here's the link..."

# Valuable content
"This will definitely help others..."
```

### 4. Error handling

**Principle: Friendly + provide solution**

```
# Not logged in
"You'll need to log in first. Run: 42plugin auth"

# Network issue
"Connection seems unstable. Want to try again?"

# Not found
"Couldn't find that one. Try different keywords?"
```

---

## What to avoid

**Rigid tables for results:**

```
| # | Type | Name | Description |
```

**Mechanical confirmations:**

```
"Please confirm installation of the following plugin: xxx"
```

**Missing links on publish:**

```
"Published successfully!" (no URL provided)
```

**Cold feedback:**

```
"Installed xxx"
```

---

## Tone variations

Same message, different styles:

**Presenting search results:**

- "Found some good options"
- "Here's what's available"
- "These are popular choices"

**Confirming install:**

- "Want to install this?"
- "Should I install it?"
- "Ready to install?"

**After installation:**

- "All set, give it a try"
- "Installed"
- "Done - this one can help you..."

Match the tone to conversation context.
